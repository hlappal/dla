# Diffusion-limited aggregation algorithm
([Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation))

The algorithm:
  * Place a seed at the center of the lattice.
  * Release a random walker from the edge.
  * Random walker sticks to the neighbouring sites of the seed/previous points.
  * Repeat N times.
